"""Running behind a path prefix — the hosting panel's live URL.

CodeNest / RunSpace (and Render-like panels in general) never expose a job on the
bare domain root. They publish

    https://<panel>/live/<job>/

and reverse-proxy everything under that prefix into the job's own port, adding

    X-Forwarded-Prefix: /live/<job>

Two things follow from that, and both used to be broken here:

1. **Links must keep the prefix.** A page served at ``/live/<job>/admin`` that
   contains ``href="/admin/files"`` sends the browser to the *panel's* root —
   a 404. The fix is small and universal: every page gets
   ``<base href="{prefix}/">`` and every root-absolute link is written without
   the leading slash, so ``href="admin/files"`` resolves through the base — with
   a prefix and without one (``<base href="/">``) alike.
2. **Redirects** (``Location: /admin/users``) are rewritten by the proxy itself,
   so they need nothing from us.

Nothing here ever trusts the header blindly: it must start with ``/``, cannot
contain ``..``, and is capped in length — a forged header can therefore only
move links around, never escape the prefix.
